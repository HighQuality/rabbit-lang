-- Declares a global object of the Program type, it can implicitly be accessed through it's type name "Program"
-- Something to note is that the type Program is not global, meaning it's only accessible in this scope; this following declaration will however expose it, however only through the object name, not the type itself (ie you can't create new instances of it) 
global Program;
